# Project Development Workflow

## Branch Protection Rules

We have implemented the following branch protection rules for our main branch to ensure code quality and maintain a structured development process:

1. **Require a pull request before merging**: All changes must be made in a separate branch and submitted via a pull request before they can be merged into the main branch.

2. **Require approvals**: Pull requests targeting the main branch require at least one approval and no changes requested before they can be merged.

3. **Require conversation resolution before merging**: All conversations and comments on the code must be resolved before a pull request can be merged.

4. **Lock branch**: The main branch is set to read-only. Users cannot push directly to this branch.

5. **No bypassing of settings**: These rules apply to all team members, including administrators.

## Development Workflow

To contribute to this project, please follow these steps:

1. **Create a new branch**: 
   - Start by creating a new branch from the latest version of the main branch.
   - Use a descriptive name for your branch, e.g., `feature/add-login` or `bugfix/fix-database-connection`.

2. **Make your changes**: 
   - Commit your changes to your new branch.
   - Push your branch to the remote repository.

3. **Open a Pull Request (PR)**:
   - When your changes are ready for review, open a pull request to merge your branch into the main branch.
   - Provide a clear description of your changes in the PR.

4. **Code Review**:
   - Wait for at least one team member to review your code.
   - Address any comments or suggestions made by reviewers.
   - Make sure all conversations are resolved.

5. **Approval**:
   - Obtain at least one approval from a team member.
   - Ensure there are no outstanding change requests.

6. **Merge**:
   - Once your PR has been approved and all conversations are resolved, you can merge your changes into the main branch.

7. **Delete your branch**:
   - After successfully merging, delete your feature or bugfix branch to keep the repository clean.

Remember, you cannot push directly to the main branch or bypass these rules, even as an administrator. This ensures that all code changes are reviewed and approved before being integrated into the main codebase.

By following this workflow, we maintain a high standard of code quality and ensure that all team members are aware of and can review changes being made to the project.
